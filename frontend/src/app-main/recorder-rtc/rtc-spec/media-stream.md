## MediaStreamTrack
this interface of the Media Capture and Streams API
represents a single media track within a stream; typically,
these are `audio` or `video` tracks, but other track types may exist as well.

Some user agents subclass this interface to provide more precise information or functionality,
such as [CanvasCaptureMediaStreamTrack](https://w3c.github.io/mediacapture-main/#introduction).

### Attributes
- `id:GUID` - generated by the browser.
- `contentHint:string` - type of content the track contains
- `enabled:boolean` - mutable to control source stream
- `kind:string` - `audio` or `video`; doesn't change if the track is disassociated from its source
- `label:string` - user agent assigned label i.e., "internal microphone"
- `muted:boolean` - if it is unable to provide media data due to technical issue.
   **Note:** use `enabled` to implement standard *mute* functionality
   ```
  stream.getAudioTracks()[0].enabled = true;// false
  ```
