            Don’t let the kernel do all the heavy lifting. Take packet handling, memory management,
            and processor scheduling out of the kernel and put it into the application,
            where it can be done efficiently. Let Linux handle the control plane and let
            the the application handle the data plane.

            The result will be a system that can handle 10 million concurrent connections
            with 200 clock cycles for packet handling and 1400 hundred clock cycles for application logic.
            As a main memory access costs 300 clock cycles it’s key to design in way that minimizes code
            and cache misses.
